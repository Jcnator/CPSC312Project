#Play Need Before Greed with the '$' command

Need Before Greed is a lottery "game" inspired by the World of Warcraft loot distribution system of the same name. Players decide if a particular item is something they "Need" or its something they'd just like to sell (Greed). The option to pass is also included in case of future expansion to make this a timed event.

Need Rolls will always take precedence over Greed Rolls
